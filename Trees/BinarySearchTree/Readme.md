# Binary Search Trees(BST)

A Binary Search Tree(BST) is a type of Binary Tree where each node can only have two children. What makes BST unique is the fact that the children on each node are inserted based on the which child is lesser or greater than the parent node. Node values lesser than parent node value are inserted as the left child of the parent node while node values greater than parent node value are inserted as the right child of the parent node.

#### Why BST?
- it allows for quick look ups because it uses a Binary Search Algorithm
- on search, half the tree nodes will be visted at worst case scenario
